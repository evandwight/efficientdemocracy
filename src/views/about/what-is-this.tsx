        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            The world has changed. We no longer live with a scarcity of information but with an abundance. Hacker news is great at collecting interesting information but has a flaw. Itâ€™s an addictive infinite feed. Each click gives you a hit of dopamine - a reward for seeking out potentially important information. It works so well because people are mostly the same; what engages others, engages you.

            We help by reducing hacker news to a minimalist weekly newsletter of only those posts you need to read. No news is good news.

            Instead of using your similarity to others to maximize engagement, we use it to lessen the work of finding that important information. If your peers think a post is important then we mark it as such. Instead of everyone individually curating the infinite feed, we crowdsource it so everyone has a lighter load.
